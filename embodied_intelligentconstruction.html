                                "Embodied Intelligent Construction" (Embodied Intelligent Construction)<BR>is a cutting-edge interdisciplinary concept that integrates artificial intelligence, robotics, building science, and cognitive science.
                                    <BR>It represents an important direction for the future development of intelligent construction.                                
                                    
                                    <BR><BR><strong >1. What is "Embodied Intelligence" (Embodied Intelligence)</strong  >
                                    <BR>"Embodied intelligence" originates from cognitive science and artificial intelligence; its core idea is:
                                    
                                    Intelligence arises not only from the brain (or algorithms) but also from real-time interactions between the body and the environment.
                                    
                                    In other words, an intelligent agent (such as a human, animal, or robot) is "smart" not only in its "brain" (e.g., AI algorithms) but also in its bodily structure, perceptual abilities, modes of motion, and how it interacts with its surroundings.
                                    
                                    <BR><BR><strong >2. What is "Embodied Intelligent Construction"</strong>
                                    <BR>Applying the concept of "embodied intelligence" to architecture and construction yields "embodied intelligent construction." It refers to:
                                    
                                    Using agents with perception, decision-making, and action capabilities (such as construction robots, drones, and wearable devices) to complete construction tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously through real-time interaction between their "bodies" and the built environment.
                                    
                                    <BR><BR><strong >3. Key characteristics of embodied intelligent construction</strong>
                                    <BR>(1) Coupling between body and environment:<BR>
                                    Robots do not plan solely in virtual space; they "see and act" on real job sites, sensing environmental changes in real time via sensors.
                                    For example, a bricklaying robot will fine‑tune its motions based on the wall's actual position rather than relying entirely on preset coordinates.
                                    <BR><BR>(2) Perception–action closed loop:<BR>
                                    The agent continuously senses the environment → makes decisions → executes actions → senses again, forming a dynamic closed loop.
                                    This makes the system more robust and adaptive.
                                    <BR><BR>(3) Multimodal interaction:<BR>
                                    Agents may combine vision, force, audio, touch, and other sensing modalities to "judge holistically" like humans.
                                    For example, an assembly robot uses force feedback to perceive whether installation is in place.
                                    <BR><BR>(4) Autonomy and collaboration:<BR>
                                    A single robot can complete tasks autonomously; multiple robots can also collaborate (e.g., drones transport materials while robotic arms handle installation).
                                    <BR><BR>(5) Learning and evolutionary capability:<BR>
                                    Through machine learning (especially reinforcement learning), robots can learn from experience and optimize construction strategies.
